# Collection of Maven plugins for GlobalId event driven architecture

This repository contains two maven plugins used for generation of asyncapi definitions and corresponding models for
GiD Quarkus services using event driven architecture. 

# Instructions

```
mvn clean verify
```
If you want to make the plugins available in your local `.m2/repository` run `mvn clean install`


# Asyncapi generator plugin

The asyncapi generator plugin scans the project for methods in classes annotated with annotations defined in the `smallrye-eda`
project. It scans the annotation parameters with the method signatures and generates a AsyncAPI schema definition for the project.
That schema definition can then further be used for generation of models, consumers, producers, etc. 

For more info see [here](asyncapi-generator-plugin/README.md)

# Amqp generator plugin
The AMQP generator plugin uses the AsyncAPI schema, generated by the `AsyncApi generator plugin` and generates a library consisting
of models, producer classes and whatnot to be used by services wanting to communicate with our service.
